# Digital-Goniometer
The Digital Goniometer is a device aimed at the measurement of joint angles, offering a alternative to traditional goniometers used in medical settings.
By leveraging Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, the device can accurately measure linear acceleration and angular velocity, enabling precise determination of joint angles.

## Features
- Accurate measurement of joint angles using IMU sensors.
- Real-time monitoring of joint movement.
- User-friendly interface for easy operation.
- Compatibility with smartphones and tablets for data visualization and analysis.
- Potential for integration with AI and machine learning algorithms for advanced functionality.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Tarani1221/Digital-Goniometer.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Connect the IMU sensors to the device according to the provided schematics.
4. Compile and upload the firmware to the device.

## Usage
1. Power on the device and ensure it is properly calibrated.
2. Place the device at the joint of interest.
3. Launch the accompanying software on your smartphone or tablet.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start measuring joint angles.
5. View real-time joint angle measurements and track progress over time.
